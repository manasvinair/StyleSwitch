# StyleSwitch
personal project to visualize concepts of CSS
I created this project to help visualize various CSS concepts, as I believe that learning by actively implementing ideas enhances understanding. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built interactive examples to explore and experiment with CSS styles and layouts. I got guidance and inspiration from Angela Yu's Udemy course, which provided a solid foundation for building this project.
